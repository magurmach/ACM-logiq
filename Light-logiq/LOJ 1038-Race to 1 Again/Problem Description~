Rimi learned a new thing about integers, which is - any positive integer greater than 1 can be divided by its divisors. So, he is now playing with this property. He selects a number N. And he calls this D.

In each turn he randomly chooses a divisor of D (1 to D). Then he divides D by the number to obtain new D. He repeats this procedure until D becomes 1. What is the expected number of moves required for N to become 1.

Input
=====

Input starts with an integer T (≤ 10000), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case begins with an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105).

Output
======

For each case of input you have to print the case number and the expected value. Errors less than 10-6 will be ignored.


Sample Input:
=============

3
1
2
50

Sample Output:
==============

Case 1: 0
Case 2: 2.00
Case 3: 3.0333333333
