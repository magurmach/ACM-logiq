A palindrome partition is the partitioning of a string such that each separate substring is a palindrome.

For example, the string "ABACABA" could be partitioned in several different ways, such as {"A","B","A","C","A","B","A"}, {"A","BACAB","A"}, {"ABA","C","ABA"}, or {"ABACABA"}, among others.

You are given a string s. Return the minimum possible number of substrings in a palindrome partition of s.

Input:
======

Input starts with an integer T (â‰¤ 40), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case begins with a non-empty string s of uppercase letters with length no more than 1000.

Output:
=======

For each case of input you have to print the case number and the desired result.


Sample Input:
=============

3
AAAA
ABCDEFGH
QWERTYTREWQWERT

Sample Output:
==============

Case 1: 1
Case 2: 8
Case 3: 5
