Problem Link  : http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1051

A string is called bad if it has 3 vowels in a row, or 5 consonants in a row, or both. A string is called good if it is not bad. You are given a string s, consisting of uppercase letters ('A'-'Z') and question marks ('?'). Return "BAD" if the string is definitely bad (that means you cannot substitute letters for question marks so that the string becomes good), "GOOD" if the string is definitely good, and "MIXED" if it can be either bad or good.

The letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' are vowels, and all others are consonants.
